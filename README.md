CV IN
Saturation Gain (Channel 1 & 2 together) – CV modulation here allows for dynamic distortion/saturation changes across the full signal, adding movement and harmonic variation.
Chorus Intensity (Channel 1 & 2 together) – This would allow for evolving modulation, making the stereo field shift between subtle and lush chorusing effects.
Mono/Stereo Mix (Dual Band) or Mid/Side Gain (M/S Mode) (Channel 2) – This gives you hands-on CV control over stereo width, making the mix expand or collapse dynamically.
Overall Dry/Wet Mix – CV control over this lets you smoothly transition between the raw and processed signal, great for build-ups, breakdowns, or evolving textures.

GATE IN
Sidechain In
Clock In -> Limiter Release Sync – Could make the limiter release in sync with the beat, so dynamics stay locked in rhythmically rather than reacting purely to the input signal.
